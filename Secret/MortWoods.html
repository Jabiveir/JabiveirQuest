    “Have you heard the stories about Mort Woods?”
It was a cold and foggy morning in the fall time. The swiftly moving wind picked up a lot of speed early this morning and could send shivers down your spine. The leaves were late to change colors this year and just started to turn shades of red and yellow. It was currently one a.m. and almost no one was out and about at this time, almost no one. <br/>
“If you look online they have all these theories about what might be going on in these woods. I was talking to one of our neighbors yesterday and he said that lady who hung themselves was real and that he actually knew and had chats with her. People in the woods say you can still see her hanging but she only stays for a second before she disappears. We should go into go into the woods some day, Kyra to try and figure out what is going on in the woods.” <br/>
It was just me and my sister walking down the gravel road barefoot standing side by side as Jolly told me about the woods we were approaching. She told me that it would be fun to go late at night and of course I listened to her. The woods have always given me this weird feeling like I am being stocked constantly and if I am not careful I could fall prey to it. I always believed in what people tell me so it is very strange that I feel safe going into the woods at night that everyone says is haunted. At least my sister will always be with me no matter where I go. As I observe Jolly, my sister I notice how much we look alike with our pale skin and light hair to our dull eyes we look more like twins then sisters. The only difference besides that she is older is that we have different personalities. She is the brave and strong-minded person whereas I am the shy and scaredy-cat type of person. Jolly is a little over a year older than me, but it feels like we have always been there for each other. Like back in 5th grade when I got bullied for being scared of the dark, which I still am, she always had my back and stood up for me.  As we move closer to the woods that I’ve roamed over a thousand times I try to take comfort in the fact that Jolly is with me as I try not to think about the dark and eerie woods ahead. <br/> 
    Finally at the entrance of the woods I start to feel uneasy but I sorta feel excited, I think. I really do not know how to feel about entering the woods, late at night, in the dark, when no else is out, when we could get lost, we could get hungry, or we could get thirsty no, no, no, I have to stop thinking like this just think of how much fun this is gonna be. Yeah, fun. <br/>
    “You ready to head in Kyra?” <br/>
    “Yep completely ready, not scared at all.” <br/>
    “Don’t worry, nothing bad will happen.” <br/>
We start picking up our pace as we enter the woods. As we enter out of the corner of my eyes I see a missing person flier. That is so sad I feel bad for whoever is missing. As we keep on moving forward I notice the color of the trees as they shine in the moonlight while the leaves are dancing in the strong winds. Roots invading the trails and trying to trip you like always. The smell of wet Earth in late fall. All these things make me feel at ease and safe in the woods, the familiar things. The woods do not seem as scary anymore. Wandering left and right following the trails that I have known for so long this is exactly where I always wanted to be. Then I see the same teepee made of broken branches. This used to be where a homeless person lived until they mysteriously died. This doesn't seem like a big deal until I realized that this is the third time I have seen the same teepee. <br/>
    “Jolly haven't we already seen the teepee like three times?” <br/>
    “Maybe I don't know I wasn't really looking.” <br/>
    “We aren't lost, are we?” <br/>
That’s when everything always goes downhill. The wind picks up speed and makes a howling noise. Every step in the woods makes it sound like someone is right behind me as it echoes off other trees. Branches start to fall off random trees making a huge cracking noise while they block many trails. The woods suddenly seems like it is trying to trap you with all of its deadly contraptions. <br/>
    “Jolly, what should we do,” I yelled as I start to work myself up. <br/>
    “It’s okay it’s okay we’re fine let’s just think this through okay, okay. Let’s just go right that seems like the right way.” <br/>
    “Okay you are right I just need to calm down. Let’s go right.” <br/>
We keep on going right and right after that and right after that when I hear a voice behind me that isn’t Jolly. <br/>
    “Welcome back I see you need some help to find your way out, am I right.” <br/>
I turn around and just stare. There is nothing else I can do but stare. There’s a literal see through person in front of me. I heard stories about how she helps others lost in the woods, but all I can think of right now is will she hurt me or help me. She is staring at me and her eyes are piercing through mine. I swear if she doesn’t kill me I am definitely going to die of a heart attack. Thankfully Jolly answers her. <br/>
    “No we are fine so you can just go back to where you came from.” <br/>
    “... As you wish,” she says as she disappears from my eyesight.   <br/>
    “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god,” I keep on repeating over and over again. “What just happened did we just see a, a, a ghoo-” <br/>
    “I think so Kyra,” Jolly says as she turns to look around the woods. “Alright so here's the plan we are gonna keep on walking right until we get out or unless we hear something that could get us out of hear, okay?” <br/>
    “Okay.” <br/>
So that is what we do as I try not to freak out about the fact that I’m lost without food or water or any kinda way to contact anyone. We walk for what feels like hours upon hours until we finally hear something.  <br/>
“Did you hear that too,” I ask. <br/>
“The police sirens yeah!” <br/>
    “Common let’s go,” I say as we run in the direction of the sirens. <br/>
    I ignore all the roots, I ignore all the paths, I even ignore the branches in my way and keep running and running and running. I run even when I can’t no more. Finally after stumbling for what feels like hours trying to get to the police sirens I can see the flashing blue and red lights, where the sirens are blaring, where I can finally be safe. Everything is great until I see her or should I say me. I am not saying me I am saying like another person who looks exactly like me and who is me being zipped up in a body bag when it all comes back to me. Who Jolly really is and why she is always with me and why I belong to Mort Woods.  <br/>
                        -------- <br/>
    “Our top story today is a story about a teenage girl named Kyra who got lost in Mort Woods earlier this week. She was last seen leaving her therapy session and waiting till later that night to enter the woods last Tuesday and hasn’t been seen since, until last night. She was found at the bottom of the hill and declared dead. The cause of death most likely was from falling off a cliff she probably didn’t see in the dark while trying to find an exit. Some say that she went into the woods because a voice she hears (as the source calls it) told her to, but nothing has been confirmed yet. Our prayers go out to her Mom and Dad. Now onto the weather…”
