        <span title>First Post and Site Reformat</span><br>
        <span>Hello! This is the first blog post that I'm making for this website. I intend to have these detail my plans and progress in regards to upcoming projects semi-frequently, so releases don't seem as random.</span><br><br>
        <span>Currently, I've got a lot planned (as you may be able to intuit from the entire site reformat). Now that the site is looking better, I plan to finish the Jabiveir Wiki; this is probably going to take quite a while, so I'm going to release each page as I finish them instead of waiting to have them all complete to release (as was the original plan). After the wiki, I want to get a rudimentary alpha version of JabiChat, a messaging app, up and running; this will be updated over time, hopefully with user requests, and it will also be another way to contact me aside from just my e-mail. After JabiChat, I have two games in mind that I want to make: Idle Rythm, which is already around half done, and Jabiveir Quest 2, which I plan to be a HUGE RPG choose-your-own-adventure game (but that will take a LONG time to make). Past that, I'd like to make some useful free software like music and art creation tools, as well as some silly, less useful stuff.</span><br><br>
        <span>While these plans are subject to change, I'm hoping that I can stick to them and get through them relatively quickly (especially considering this is the first real update I've made to the site since January).</span><br><br>
        <span>Thank you for reading, and I hope you have fun on the site!</span>
